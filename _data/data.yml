  details: |
    As a graduate researcher with expertise in NLP and ML, I am currently interning at Ubisoft where I am responsible for researching and developing large language models for classifying harmful comments in in-game chats. My work includes determining the generalization potential of these models to different games, data wrangling, incorporating techniques for continuous learning, and implementing a systematic experiment pipeline to improve my research. My research is focused on applied NLP such as topic modeling and multi-label classification with noisy labels. I possess expertise in Python and related machine learning and deep learning frameworks, with a proven track record of solid practical understanding. Furthermore, I demonstrate strong collaboration skills and can effectively communicate my work to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

    - role: R&D NLP Intern
      time: 2022.05 - Present
      company: Ubisoft (La Forge)
      tag: NLP
      location: Montreal
      details: |
        Experience in this company:
        + Research and development of deep NLP models for classifying harmful comments in in-game chats, determining their generalization potential to different games, and improving model recall by 82% while maintaining precision at 82%.
        + Experimentation on determining the amount of retraining or fine-tuning necessary for candidate models to adapt to new game vocabularies.
        + Documenting and sharing research findings internally, including NLP techniques used, performance evaluation and insights gained to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
        + Participation in data selection and pre-processing of labeled data, including sampling chat lines to be annotated, text cleaning, and aggregating weak and noisy labels.
        + Incorporation of continuous learning techniques to minimize model drift and improve the final model's ability to detect harmful messages using active learning and self-learning.
        + Proposing and implementing a systematic experiment pipeline for increased code readability, complete experiment reproducibility, and experiment logging.

    - role: Graduate Research Assistant
      time: 2021.01 - Present
      company: Mila - Complex Data Lab
      tag: NLP
      location: Montreal
      details: |
        Experience in this company:
        + Conducted research on COVID-19 topic modeling with LDA, topic keywords, and BERT Language model on a large dataset of over 387M Twitter Tweets and 7M Parler post
        + Trained a state-of-the-art Roberta-large LM with an accuracy of 90% on politically explicit user profile descriptions to detect user party affiliations.
        + Utilized machine learning techniques to train a random forest model with an accuracy of 94% to predict user party from COVID-19 tweets.
        + Geolocated 7.7M Twitter users with high precision by extracting proper locations with named-entity recognition on user provided locations and running them through OSM and ArcGIS API.
        + Matched 32K Twitter users to US Voter Registration Records based on matching names and address, demonstrating expertise in data matching and integration.
        + Applied bootstrapping methods to approximate variation of cluster distances (C-index, Silhouette score) to measure partisan polarization for large-scale data (over 80K users)
        + Designed multiple visualizations on Bokeh and Matplotlib for daily and state-wide partisan polarization on COVID-19 topics of Lockdown, Mask and Vaccine, demonstrating expertise in data visualization.
